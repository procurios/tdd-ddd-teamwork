### Preparation

One of the goals of this workshop is to test your **attitude**. Please think about and answer these following questions
to get a basic understanding. It doesn't have to be perfect and shouldn't take more than a couple of minutes.
Please note that "tend to" does not mean one or the other exclusively. Just go with the first choice that comes up for
you.

* At the start of a new project, I tend to
  - Think big and work out the general picture
  - Work out some details and start coding to get a better understanding
* While coding...
  - I only start coding when I see the bigger picture
  - I regularly throw code away and start over
* I can easily talk and type at the same time
  - disagree
  - agree
* When someone shares an idea with me, I tend to
  - See potential problems and risks
  - Get ideas of my own
* When I face an obstacle I tend to
  - sit down and get to the bottom of it
  - park it and work on something else for a bit

The more questions you have answered with the first answer, the more we think you tend to pessimism. In short we think
this means you tend to converge easier than diverge and that you tend to push on the brakes more than the gas.

The more questions have have answered with the second answer, the more we think you tend towards optimism. In short we
think this means you tend to diverge easier than converge and that you tend to push on the gas more than the brakes.

## During the workshop

We will divide you up into teams of four and hand out your assignments, preferably mixed nicely between optimists and
pessimists.

### Rules

- Be kind, considerate and respectful
- Listen; allow your peers space and time
- No one is required to "drive"/type

### Content

The first hour of the workshop will focus on TDD, the second hour will focus on Teamwork and the third hour will focus
on DDD.

Good luck!
